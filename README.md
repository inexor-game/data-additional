# Additional data
This is a temporary data repository. The data of this repository will also be included in the alpha releases together with the content of the [regular data repo](https://github.com/inexor-game/data).
This repository should provide testers and early players a bit more content, however as soon as we have implemented an ingame content downloader, we won't need this additional repository anymore and we will drop it completely. Of course, the content creators can then start to deliver their content on their own, so the content isn't lost.

Content within this repository have still to fit our [License Policy](https://github.com/inexor-game/code/wiki/License-Policy), but doesn't need to fit our high quality standards for content in our regular repository.
